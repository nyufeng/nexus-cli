## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Precompiled Binary (Recommended)

For the simplest and most reliable installation:

```bash
curl https://cli.nexus.xyz/ | sh
```

This will:
1. Download and install the latest precompiled binary for your platform.
2. Prompt you to accept the Terms of Use.
3. Start the CLI in interactive mode.

The template installation script is viewable [here](./public/install.sh.template).

#### Non-Interactive Installation

For automated installations (e.g., in CI):

```bash
curl -sSf https://cli.nexus.xyz/ -o install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
NONINTERACTIVE=1 ./install.sh
```

### Proving

Proving with the CLI is documented [here](https://docs.nexus.xyz/layer-1/testnet/cli-node).

To start with an existing node ID, run:

```bash
nexus-cli start --node-id <your-node-id>
```

Alternatively, you can register your wallet address and create a node ID with the CLI, or at [app.nexus.xyz](https://app.nexus.xyz).

```bash
nexus-cli register-user --wallet-address <your-wallet-address>
nexus-cli register-node
nexus-cli start
```

To run the CLI noninteractively, you can also opt to start it in headless mode.

```bash
nexus-cli start --headless
```

### Adaptive Task Difficulty

The Nexus CLI features an intelligent **adaptive difficulty system** that automatically adjusts task difficulty based on your node's performance. This ensures optimal resource utilization while preventing system overload.

#### How It Works

**Default Behavior:**
- **Starts at**: `SmallMedium` difficulty (appropriate for most CLI users)
- **Promotes to**: `Medium` â†’ `Large` based on performance
- **Promotion Criteria**: Only promotes if previous task completed in < 7 minutes
- **Safety Limit**: Stops at `Large` difficulty (no automatic promotion to `ExtraLarge`)

**Promotion Path:**
```
SmallMedium â†’ Medium â†’ Large
     â†‘           â†‘        â†‘
   Default    < 7 min   < 7 min
              success   success
```

#### When to Override Difficulty

You might want to manually set difficulty in these scenarios:

**Lower Difficulty (`Small` or `SmallMedium`):**
- **Resource-Constrained Systems**: Limited CPU, memory, or storage
- **Background Processing**: Running alongside other intensive applications
- **Testing/Development**: Want faster task completion for testing
- **Battery-Powered Devices**: Laptops or mobile devices where power efficiency matters

**Higher Difficulty (`Large` or `ExtraLarge`):**
- **High-Performance Hardware**: Powerful CPUs with many cores and abundant RAM
- **Dedicated Proving Machines**: Systems dedicated solely to proving tasks
- **Experienced Users**: Advanced users who understand resource requirements
- **Maximum Rewards**: Want to earn maximum rewards from challenging tasks

#### Using Difficulty Override

Override the adaptive system with the `--max-difficulty` argument:

```bash
# Use lower difficulty for resource-constrained systems
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small_medium

# Use higher difficulty for powerful hardware
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty large
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large

# Case-insensitive (all equivalent)
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty MEDIUM
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty medium
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty Medium
```

**Available Difficulty Levels:**
- `SMALL` - Basic tasks, minimal resource usage
- `SMALL_MEDIUM` - Default starting difficulty, balanced performance
- `MEDIUM` - Moderate complexity, good for most systems
- `LARGE` - High complexity, requires powerful hardware
- `EXTRA_LARGE` - Maximum complexity, only for dedicated high-end systems

#### Difficulty Guidelines

| Difficulty | CPU Cores | RAM | Task Duration | Use Case |
|------------|-----------|-----|---------------|----------|
| `SMALL` | 2-4 cores | 4-8 GB | 1-3 minutes | Resource-constrained, background |
| `SMALL_MEDIUM` | 4-6 cores | 8-12 GB | 2-5 minutes | Default, balanced performance |
| `MEDIUM` | 6-8 cores | 12-16 GB | 3-7 minutes | Standard desktop/laptop |
| `LARGE` | 8+ cores | 16+ GB | 5-15 minutes | High-performance systems |
| `EXTRA_LARGE` | 12+ cores | 24+ GB | 10-30 minutes | Dedicated proving machines |

#### Monitoring Performance

The CLI automatically tracks your node's performance and adjusts difficulty accordingly. You can monitor this in the dashboard:

- **Task Completion Time**: Shown in the metrics panel
- **Difficulty Level**: Current difficulty displayed in the info panel
- **Promotion Status**: Whether the system is promoting or maintaining current level

#### Troubleshooting Difficulty Issues

**If tasks are taking too long:**
```bash
# Lower the difficulty
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small_medium
```

**If you want more challenging tasks:**
```bash
# Increase the difficulty
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty large
```

**If you're unsure about your system's capabilities:**
- Start with the default adaptive system (no `--max-difficulty` argument)
- Monitor task completion times in the dashboard
- Adjust manually based on performance

For detailed information about the adaptive difficulty system, see [ADAPTIVE_DIFFICULTY.md](./ADAPTIVE_DIFFICULTY.md).

#### Quick Reference

**Common Difficulty Commands:**
```bash
# Default adaptive difficulty
nexus-cli start

# Resource-constrained systems
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty small

# High-performance systems  
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty large

# Maximum performance
nexus-cli start --max-difficulty extra_large
```

The `register-user` and `register-node` commands will save your credentials to `~/.nexus/config.json`. To clear credentials, run:

```bash
nexus-cli logout
```

For troubleshooting or to see available command-line options, run:

```bash
nexus-cli --help
```

### Use Docker
Make sure Docker and Docker Compose have been installed on your machine. Check documentation here:
- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Then, modify the node ID in the `docker-compose.yaml` file, run:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

Check log

```bash
docker compose logs
```

If you want to shut down, run:

```bash
docker compose down
```

## Terms of Use

Use of the CLI is subject to the [Terms of Use](https://nexus.xyz/terms-of-use).
First-time users running interactively will be prompted to accept these terms.

---

## Node ID

During the CLI's startup, you'll be asked for your node ID. To skip prompts in a
non-interactive environment, manually create a `~/.nexus/config.json` in the
following format:

```json
{
   "node_id": "<YOUR NODE ID>"
}
```

## Contributing

Interested in contributing to the Nexus Network CLI? Check out our
[Contributor Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for:

- Development setup instructions
- How to report issues and submit pull requests
- Our code of conduct and community guidelines
- Tips for working with the codebase

For most users, we recommend using the precompiled binaries as described above.
The contributor guide is intended for those who want to modify or improve the CLI
itself.

### ðŸ›   Developer Guide

The following steps may be required in order to set up a development environment for contributing to the project:

#### Linux

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libssl-dev git-all
sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
```

#### macOS

```bash
# Install using Homebrew
brew install protobuf

# Verify installation
protoc --version
```

#### Windows

[Install WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install),
then see Linux instructions above.

```bash
# Install using Chocolatey
choco install protobuf
```

### Building ProtoBuf files

To build the ProtoBuf files, run the following command in the `clients/cli` directory:

```bash
cargo build --features build_proto
```

### Creating a Release

To create a release, update the package version in `Cargo.toml`, then create and push a new (annotated) tag, e.g.:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.2 -m "Release v0.1.2"
git push origin v0.1.2
```

This will trigger the GitHub Actions release workflow that compiles binaries and pushes the Docker image, in
addition to creating release.

**WARNING**: Creating a release through the GitHub UI creates a new release but does **NOT** trigger
the workflow. This leads to a release without a Docker image or binaries, which breaks the installation script.
